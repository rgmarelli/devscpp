# devsCPP

__devsCPP__ is a DEVS C++ library for the Discrete Event System Specification.
The framework features:
* Functionality for distributing the simulation across multiple processes or computers.
* Interfaces to interact with external software (software-in-the-loop) or hardward (hardware-in-the-loop).
* A simple user interface that allows basic control of the simulation.
* Facilities to run the simulation: step by step, as fast as possible and in real time.
